# trezy-irc
This is an IRC client built with node-irc running in nwjs. I'm calling it trezy-irc because I can't come up with a better name at the moment.

# Running
Make sure you have `nwjs` installed globally:

```
npm install -g nwjs
```

Then run `grunt` to build your Sass files:

```
grunt
```

Finally, run `nwjs` to launch the app.
